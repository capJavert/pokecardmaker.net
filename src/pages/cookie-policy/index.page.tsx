        <Typography>
          In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or

      <PolicySection title="What are cookies?">
        <Typography>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Shinebrothers) are
          called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called &quot;third party cookies&quot;.
          Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive
          content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies
          can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
          question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </Typography>
      </PolicySection>
      <PolicySection title="Why do we use cookies?">
        <Typography>
          We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
          are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to
          operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
          &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us
          to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
          experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
          through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
          This is described in more detail below.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
          Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please
          note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
          specific Online Properties you visit):

      <PolicySection title="How can I control cookies?">
        <Typography>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
          select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
          on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
          website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
          website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
          controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can
          refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
          browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser&apos;s help menu for
          more information.

        <Typography>We do not use web beacons or tracking pixels.</Typography>
        <Typography>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. Similar technologies, like web beacons (sometimes called
          &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or &quot;clear gifs&quot;) exist. These
          are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable
          us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an
          e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the
          traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another,
          to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
          come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
          third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
          success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
          technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
          declining cookies will impair their functioning.

      <PolicySection title="Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?">
        <Typography>
          Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known
          as Local Shared Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among other things,
          collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud
          prevention and for other site operations.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
          adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies
          storage using the tools contained in the{' '}

          and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
          explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred
          to &quot;information&quot; on the Macromedia site), how to prevent
          Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being
          asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies
          that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at
          the time).
